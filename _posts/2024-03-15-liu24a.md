abstract: 'Over the past decades, network biology has been a major driver of computational
  methods developed to better understand the functional roles of each gene in the
  human genome in their cellular context. Following the application of traditional
  semi-supervised and supervised machine learning (ML) techniques, the next wave of
  advances in network biology will come from leveraging graph neural networks (GNN).
  However, to test new GNN-based approaches, a systematic and comprehensive benchmarking
  resource that spans a diverse selection of biomedical networks and gene classification
  tasks is lacking. Here, we present the Open Biomedical Network Benchmark (OBNB),
  a collection of node-classification benchmarking datasets derived using networks
  from 15 sources and tasks that include predicting genes associated with a wide range
  of functions, traits, and diseases. The accompanying Python package, obnb, contains
  reusable modules that enable researchers to download source data from public databases
  or archived versions and set up ML-ready datasets that are compatible with popular
  GNN frameworks such as PyG and DGL. Our work lays the foundation for novel GNN applications
  in network biology. obob will also help network biologists easily set-up custom
  benchmarking datasets for answering new questions of interest and collaboratively
  engage with graph ML practitioners to enhance our understanding of the human genome.
