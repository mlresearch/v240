abstract: Survival prediction, central to the analysis of clinical trials, has the
  potential to be transformed by the availability of RNA-seq data as it reveals the
  underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms for disease and outcomes. However, the
  amount of RNA-seq samples available for understudied or rare diseases is often limited.
  To address this, leveraging data across different cancer types can be a viable solution,
  necessitating the application of self-supervised learning techniques. Yet, this
  wealth of data often comes in a tabular format without a known structure, hindering
  the development of a generally effective augmentation method for survival prediction.
  While traditional methods have been constrained by a one cancer-one model philosophy
  or have relied solely on a single modality, our approach, Guided-STab, on the contrary,
  offers a comprehensive approach through pretraining on all available RNA-seq data
  from various cancer types while guiding the representation by incorporating sparse
  clinical features as auxiliary tasks. With a multitask-guided self-supervised representation
  learning framework, we maximize the potential of vast unlabeled datasets from various
  cancer types, leading to genomic-driven survival predictions. These auxiliary clinical
  tasks then guide the learned representations to enhance critical survival factors.
  Extensive experiments reinforce the promise of our approach, as Guided-STab consistently
  outperforms established benchmarks on TCGA dataset.
