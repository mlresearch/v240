abstract: Computational genomics increasingly relies on machine learning methods for
  genome interpretation, and the recent adoption of neural sequence-to-function models
  highlights the need for rigorous model specification and controlled evaluation,
  problems familiar to other fields of AI. Research strategies that have greatly benefited
  other fields — including benchmarking, auditing, and algorithmic fairness — are
  also needed to advance the field of genomic AI and to facilitate model development.
  Here we propose a genomic AI benchmark, GUANinE, for evaluating model generalization
  across a number of distinct genomic tasks. Compared to existing task formulations
  in computational genomics, GUANinE is large-scale, de-noised, and suitable for evaluating
  pretrained models. GUANinE v1.0 primarily focuses on functional genomics tasks such
  as functional element annotation and gene expression prediction, and it also draws
  upon connections to evolutionary biology through sequence conservation tasks. The
  current GUANinE tasks provide insight into the performance of existing genomic AI
  models and non-neural baselines, with opportunities to be refined, revisited, and
  broadened as the field matures. Finally, the GUANinE benchmark allows us to evaluate
  new self-supervised T5 models and explore the tradeoffs between tokenization and
  model performance, while showcasing the potential for self-supervision to complement
  existing pretraining procedures.
