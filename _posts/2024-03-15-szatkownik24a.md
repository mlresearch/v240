abstract: Synthetic data generation via generative modeling has recently become a
  prominent research field in genomics, with applications ranging from functional
  sequence design to high-quality, privacy-preserving artificial in silico genomes.
  Following a body of work on Artificial Genomes (AGs) created via various generative
  models trained with raw genomic input, we propose a conceptually different approach
  to address the issues of scalability and complexity of genomic data generation in
  very high dimensions. Our method combines dimensionality reduction, achieved by
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) learning
  in this reduced space. We compare the quality of AGs generated by our approach with
  AGs generated by the established models and report improvements on capturing population
  structure and linkage disequilibrium.
