abstract: 'Generative models for multimodal data permit the identification of latent
  factors that may be associated with important determinants of observed data heterogeneity.
  Common or shared factors could be important for explaining variation across modalities
  whereas other factors may be private and important only for the explanation of a
  single modality. Multimodal Variational Autoencoders, such as MVAE and MMVAE, are
  a natural choice for inferring those underlying latent factors and separating shared
  variation from private. In this work, we investigate their capability to reliably
  perform this disentanglement. In particular, we highlight a challenging problem
  setting where modality-specific variation dominates the shared signal. Taking a
  cross-modal prediction perspective, we demonstrate limitations of existing models,
  and propose a modification how to make them more robust to modality-specific variation.
  Our findings are supported by experiments on synthetic as well as various real-world
  multi-omics data sets. '
