abstract: Alternative splicing (AS) contributes significantly to RNA and protein variability
  yet its role in defining cellular diversity is not fully understood. While Smart-seq2
  offers enhanced coverage across transcripts compared to 10X single cell RNA-sequencing
  (scRNA-seq), current computational methods often miss the full complexity of AS.
  Most approaches for single cell based differential splicing analysis focus on simple
  AS events such as exon skipping, and rely on predefined cell type labels or low-dimensional
  gene expression representations. This limits their ability to detect more complex
  AS events and makes them dependent on prior knowledge of cell classifications. Here,
  we present Leaflet, a splice junction centric approach inspired by Leafcutter, our
  tool for quantifying RNA splicing variation with bulk RNA-seq. Leaflet is a probabilistic
  mixture model designed to infer AS-driven cell states without the need for cell
  type labels. We detail Leafletâ€™s generative model, inference methodology, and its
  efficiency in detecting differentially spliced junctions. By applying Leaflet to
  the Tabula Muris brain cell dataset, we highlight cell-state specific splicing patterns,
  offering a deeper insight into cellular diversity beyond that captured by gene expression
  alone.
