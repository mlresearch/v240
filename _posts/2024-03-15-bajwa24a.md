abstract: 'Genomic sequence-to-activity models are increasingly utilized to understand
  gene regulatory syntax and probe the functional consequences of regulatory variation.
  Current models make accurate predictions of relative activity levels across the
  human reference genome, but their performance is more limited for predicting the
  effects of genetic variants, such as explaining gene expression variation across
  individuals. To better understand the causes of these shortcomings, we examine the
  uncertainty in predictions of genomic sequence-to-activity models using an ensemble
  of Basenji2 model replicates. We characterize prediction consistency on four types
  of sequences: reference genome sequences, reference genome sequences perturbed with
  TF motifs, eQTLs, and personal genome sequences. We observe that models tend to
  make high-confidence predictions on reference sequences, even when incorrect, and
  low-confidence predictions on sequences with variants. For eQTLs and personal genome
  sequences, we find that model replicates make inconsistent predictions in >50% of
  cases. Our findings suggest strategies to improve performance of these models. '
