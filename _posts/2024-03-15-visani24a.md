abstract: 'Accurately modeling protein 3D structure is essential for the design of
  functional proteins. An important sub-task of structure modeling is protein side-chain
  packing: predicting the conformation of side-chains (rotamers) given the protein’s
  backbone structure and amino-acid sequence. Conventional approaches for this task
  rely on expensive sampling procedures over hand-crafted energy functions and rotamer
  libraries. Recently, several deep learning methods have been developed to tackle
  the problem in a data-driven way, albeit with vastly different formulations (from
  image-to-image translation to directly predicting atomic coordinates). Here, we
  frame the problem as a joint regression over the side-chains’ true degrees of freedom:
  the dihedral $\chi$ angles. We carefully study possible objective functions for
  this task, while accounting for the underlying symmetries of the task. We propose
  Holographic Packer (H-Packer), a novel two-stage algorithm for side-chain packing
  built on top of two light-weight rotationally equivariant neural networks. We evaluate
  our method on CASP13 and CASP14 targets. H-Packer is computationally efficient and
  shows favorable performance against conventional physics-based algorithms and is
  competitive against alternative deep learning solutions.'
