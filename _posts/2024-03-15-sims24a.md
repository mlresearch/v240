abstract: Cyclic Immunofluorescence (CyCIF) has emerged as a powerful technique that
  can measure multiple biomarkers in a single tissue sample but it is limited in panel
  size due to technical issues and tissue loss. We develop a computational model that
  imputes a surrogate in silico high-plex CyCIF from only a few experimentally measured
  biomarkers by learning co-expression and morphological patterns at the single-cell
  level. The reduced panel is optimally designed to enable full reconstruction of
  an expanded marker panel that retains the information from the original panel necessary
  for downstream analysis. Using a masked image modeling approach based on the self-supervised
  training objective of reconstructing full images at the single-cell level, we demonstrate
  significant performance improvement over previous attempts on the breast cancer
  tissue microarray dataset. Our approach offers users access to a more extensive
  set of biomarkers beyond what has been experimentally measured. It also allows for
  allocating resources toward exploring novel biomarkers and facilitates greater cell
  type differentiation and disease characterization. Additionally, it can handle assay
  failures such as low-quality markers, technical noise, and/or tissue loss in later
  rounds as well as artificially upsample to include additional panel markers.
