abstract: Synergy models are useful tools for exploring drug combinatorial search
  space and identifying promising sub-spaces for in vitro/vivo experiments. Here,
  we report that distributional biases in the training-validation-test sets used for
  predictive modeling of drug synergy can explain much of the variability observed
  in model performances (up to $0.22$ $\Delta$AUPRC). We built 145 classification
  models spanning 4,577 unique drugs and 75,276 pair-wise drug combinations extracted
  from DrugComb, and examined spurious correlations in both the input feature and
  output label spaces. We posit that some synergy datasets are easier to model than
  others due to factors such as synergy spread, class separation, chemical structural
  diversity, physicochemical diversity, combinatorial tests per drug, and combinatorial
  label entropy. We simulate distribution shifts for these dataset attributes and
  report that the drug-wise homogeneity of combinatorial labels most influences modelability
  ($0.16\pm0.06$ $\Delta$AUPRC). Our findings imply that seemingly high-performing
  drug synergy models may not generalize well to broader medicinal space. We caution
  that the synergy modeling communityâ€™s efforts may be better expended in examining
  data-specific artefacts and biases rigorously prior to model building.
