abstract: How can we stratify patients into subgroups based on their expected survival
  in a purely data-driven manner? Identifying cancer patients at higher risk is crucial
  in planning personalized treatment to improve patient survival outcomes. The main
  challenge with existing approaches is the underlying complexity of handling censoring
  in the survival data and manually setting a precise threshold to stratify patients
  into risk groups. In this paper, a Transductive Survival Ranking (TSR) model for
  patient risk stratification is proposed. The model handles samples in pairs to make
  use of instances with censored survival information. It incorporates unlabeled test
  samples in the training process to maximize the margin between their predicted survival
  scores resulting in automatic patient stratification into subgroups without the
  need for any additional post-processing or manual threshold selection. The model
  was evaluated on several datasets with varying sets of covariates, and all stratification
  were significant ($p < 0.05$) with high concordance indices of up to 0.78 in Disease
  Specific Survival and 0.75 in Overall Survival.
