abstract: 'Due to the rapid increase and importance of multiplexed immunofluorescence
  (mIF) imaging data in spatial biology, there is a pressing need to develop efficient
  image-to-image search pipelines for both diagnostic and research purposes. While
  several image search methods have been introduced for conventional images and digital
  pathology, mIF images present three main challenges: (1) high dimensionality, (2)
  domain-specificity, and (3) complex additional molecular information. To address
  this gap, we introduce the MIISS framework, a Multi-granularity mIF Image Similarity
  Search pipeline that employs self-supervised learning models to extract features
  from mIF image patches and an entropy-based aggregation method to enable similarity
  searches at higher, multi-granular levels. We then benchmarked various feature generation
  approaches to handle high dimensional images and tested them on various foundation
  models. We conducted evaluations using datasets from different tissues on both patch-
  and patient-level, which demonstrate the frameworkâ€™s effectiveness and generalizability.
  Notably, we found that domain-specific models consistently outperformed other models,
  further showing their robustness and generalizability across different datasets.
  The MIISS framework offers an effective solution for navigating the growing landscape
  of mIF images, providing tangible clinical benefits and opening new avenues for
  pathology research.'
