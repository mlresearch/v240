abstract: 'The T-cell receptor (TCR) allows T-cells to recognize and respond to antigens
  presented by infected and diseased cells. However, due to TCRs’ staggering diversity
  and the complex binding dynamics underlying TCR antigen recognition, it is challenging
  to predict which antigens a given TCR may bind to. Here, we present TCR-BERT, a
  deep learning model that applies self-supervised transfer learning to this problem.
  TCR-BERT leverages unlabeled TCR sequences to learn a general, versatile representation
  of TCR sequences, enabling numerous downstream applications. TCR-BERT can be used
  to build state-of-the-art TCR-antigen binding predictors with improved generalizability
  compared to prior methods. Simultaneously, TCR-BERT’s embeddings yield clusters
  of TCRs likely to share antigen specificities. It also enables computational approaches
  to challenging, unsolved problems such as designing novel TCR sequences with engineered
  binding affinities. Importantly, TCR-BERT enables all these advances by focusing
  on residues with known biological significance. '
